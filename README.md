# ToDoList_App
The To-Do List Web Application is a simple yet functional task management system that allows users to add, edit, mark, and delete tasks. This project does not use a database but instead utilizes localStorage to save tasks. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a responsive and interactive user experience.
