📌 To-Do List Web Application (Without Database)
📖 Project Overview
The To-Do List Web Application is a simple yet functional task management system that allows users to add, edit, mark, and delete tasks. This project does not use a database but instead utilizes localStorage to save tasks, ensuring persistence even after refreshing the page.

🎯 Features
✅ 1. Add Tasks
Users can type a task in the input field and press "Add" or press Enter to save it.
The task appears in a scrollable list.
✅ 2. Save Tasks (Using localStorage)
Tasks are saved in the browser using localStorage.
Even if the page is refreshed or reopened, tasks remain in the list.
✅ 3. Mark Task as Completed
Users can check/uncheck a task to mark it as completed.
Completed tasks have a strike-through effect.
✅ 4. Edit Tasks
Clicking on a task allows the user to edit the text.
The edited text is automatically updated in localStorage.
✅ 5. Delete a Task
Each task has a red ‘X’ button to delete it individually.
✅ 6. Delete All Tasks
A "Delete All" button clears all tasks after confirmation.
